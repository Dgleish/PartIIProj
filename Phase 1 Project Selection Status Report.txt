Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Alex Dalgleish

College: Robinson

User Identifier: amd96

Director of Studies: Alastair Beresford

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

    My core idea is to develop a collaborative, peer-to-peer, text editor.
    This will use operation-based CRDTs to handle concurrent operations.
    This may be an Android, desktop or web application, but will have minimal UI.

    I plan to build it in stages:
        1) Write a CRDT library
        2) Create a client-server text editor using the library
        3) Make it completely P2P
        4) Extensions

    Possible extensions are as follows:
        a) Encrypt and use the Tor network for all communication
        b) Support >2 users & allow coming and going at any time
        c) Make a GUI
        d) Create a generic library for collaborative P2P applications

    This allows me to compare latency/bandwidth usage etc.
    on the two different network architectures.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

    My own machine: 4x2GHz CPU, 8Gb RAM, 300Gb Disk, Ubuntu 16.04LTS
    I will keep everything in a git repository on GitHub.
    Weekly backups will also be done to an external hard drive.
    I may also need support for Tor on my machine.
