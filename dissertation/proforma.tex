\section*{Original Aim of the Project}
In this project I aimed to build a library for doing peer-to-peer collaborative editing with CRDTs as data structures. This could be used easily by an application like a TODO list or general text editor to allow for collaboration over a network. The peer-to-peer approach was taken to mitigate privacy concerns when data flows through untrusted servers. 

\section*{Work Completed}
The library was successfully built, along with a simple text editor using it. In addition, two contrasting CRDT approaches have been used and compared, support for local undoing of operations has been added, and there is the option of communicating over the Tor overlay network for anonymous collaboration.

  \section*{Special Difficulties}
  None.
