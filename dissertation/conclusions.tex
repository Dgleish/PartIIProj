\label{chap:conclusions}
Overall, the project was a success. I implemented a library for a P2P collaborative editing application using CRDTs, then showed by building a minimal user interface that it can be utilised properly. I also implemented a number of other extensions to my original proposal, including encryption, allowing communication over the Tor network, a contrasting data structure for the CRDT, and an undo-redo feature. I then showed that the application displayed reasonable memory usage and latency, so was suitable for use in a desktop application. My conclusion on reliability is somewhat weaker, but it seems that my work would not be responsible for a communication failure, though unfortunately I didn't have time to include any retrying logic over TCPs own.

In hindsight, the domain of the project was quite broad; I touched on areas of distributed systems, networking and security. It would have been nice to be able to focus more in-depth in one of these areas, for example looking at the different CRDT schemes more closely. That being said, I was able to go into sufficient detail to understand and implement the LSEQ scheme, which was the topic of a recent research paper, though I would have liked to explore its allocation strategies more, and see if I could come up with one of my own that performed better than their random-choice strategy.

There are a number of future directions this project could be taken in. One would be to focus on the CRDTs, and look at string-level editing (ie an atom is a sequence of characters, rather than just a single one), where strings can be dynamically split up into smaller strings. This approach could save a lot in terms of memory usage. Alternatively, more work could be put into the networking side, and look at other ways of connecting peers together, to prevent the need for a fully connected graph, for example randomly dropping some of the $n^2$ links and allowing partitions to occur. Also, work could be done to cryptographically sign operations sent over a network, so that the source of the operation could be verified.
